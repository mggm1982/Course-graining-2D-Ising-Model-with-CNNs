This project demonstrates a fundamental concept in modern computational physics: **neural networks can learn to perform complex physical transformations**. Coarse-graining is typically done through carefully designed analytical or numerical methods. Here, we show that a simple CNN can learn this transformation purely from data, achieving:
- Better efficiency (9.6K parameters vs traditional RG calculations)
- Comparable accuracy to block averaging
- Potential for more complex coarse-graining schemes

**For Physics:**
- Neural networks can assist in renormalization group studies
- Potential to discover non-obvious coarse-graining schemes
- Could be extended to quantum systems or other statistical mechanics models

**For Machine Learning:**
- Shows importance of inductive biases (CNN vs MLP)
- Demonstrates that physics problems provide excellent testbeds
- Validates that deep learning can capture physical symmetries

**Current Limitations:**
1. Fixed coarse-graining ratio (2×2)
2. Limited to equilibrium configurations
3. Single observable (spin configurations)

**Suggested Extensions:**
1. **Test at criticality**: Generate more configurations exactly at T_c to see behavior near phase transition
2. **Correlation function preservation**: Analyze two-point and higher-order correlation functions
3. **Variable coarse-graining factors**: Try 3×3, 4×4 blocks or even learned variable ratios
4. **Dynamic properties**: Extend to time-dependent configurations
5. **Other models**: Apply to Potts model, XY model, or Heisenberg model
6. **Learned blocking**: Allow the network to learn optimal blocking beyond simple averaging
7. **Inverse mapping**: Train a network to go from coarse → fine (super-resolution)
8. **Physical constraints**: Enforce conservation laws or symmetries in the architecture
